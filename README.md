# sql_Database_ITA


The project is realized in Italian.
It consists in the creation of an sql database, in which all aspects of the database are examined, relating each entity and completing, from an initial drafted schema, the entire database, normalizing and making the search on it efficient.
The implementation, from the initial draft to the final code, is found in the file:
### Analysis.pdf
Other files are the **queries.sql**, in which you can find a bunch of possible queries to examinate the db, and **implementazione.sql**, in which there is the entire implementation
